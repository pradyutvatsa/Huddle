## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- A deeper understanding of how flexbox and Grid system works in CSS
- Understanding of a more nuanced distinction between web design and development
- Using calculation in CSS properties and its impact on real-time site rendering
- Fiddling around svgs as a way to insert images in web pages

### Continued development

- Need to invest time in understanding responsiveness in images as a digital asset on the web
- Need to invest time to structure a flow of the code as a site renders across different devices 

### Useful resources
